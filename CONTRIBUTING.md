# Eepy - Contributing Guide

We welcome contributions from the community!

However, we can't guarantee that all major changes that go beyond bug fixes will be accepted. Eepy is intentionally minimal and opinionated, and while there are many other features that could be bundled here, we want to be selected about what makes the cut.

## Steps

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the Eepy repository.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Make a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your changes and ensure they follow the project's coding style.
4.  **Submit a Pull Request to the `dev` branch:** Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
    *   The `main` branch is managed by our CI workflows, which copies the source files to the top level on pushes to `dev`. This makes it easier for someone browsing the repo to view the source files without digging into the source project.
